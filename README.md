# enovasense-modbus-client

This repository contains a lightweight client to connect to the 
Enovasense Modbus TCP server. It uses libmodbus as a dependency and was 
tested with libmodbus 3.1.6 and 3.1.7. It was build with MinGW here, but 
libmodbus is MSVC friendly.

More info on libmodbus on the github: https://github.com/stephane/libmodbus
We used libmodbus, but you can use any Modbus TCP client, really. I mean... REALLY. Modbus TCP is available on 
PLCs, robots, more robots, Python, C/C++, anything.

Do not hesitate to contact Enovasense if you have any question about the code sample.
